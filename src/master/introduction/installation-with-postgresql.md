## Start Using UnoPim

### On a Production Server

To access UnoPim on a production server, open your domain in a web browser. For example:

```
https://example.com/
```

### On Your Local Server

To access UnoPim on your local server, follow these steps:

1. Configure your HTTP server to point to the **`public/`** directory of the project.
2. Run the following command:

    ```sh
    php artisan serve
    ```

3. Open your browser and access the provided local server URL.


## Configure the Virtual Host

Depending on your web server, you can configure UnoPim with either **Apache 2** or **NGINX**.

---

### Configure Using Apache 2

#### Creating the Virtual Host File

Create the file **`/etc/apache2/sites-available/unopim.local.conf`**:

```apache
<VirtualHost *:80>
    ServerName unopim.local

    DocumentRoot /path/to/installation/unopim/public
    <Directory /path/to/installation/unopim/public>
        Options FollowSymLinks MultiViews
        AllowOverride All
        Require all granted
    </Directory>

    ReWriteEngine On

    <FilesMatch \.php$>
        SetHandler "proxy:unix:/run/php/php8.2-fpm.sock|fcgi://localhost/"
    </FilesMatch>

    ErrorLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/unopim_error.log
    LogLevel warn
    CustomLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/unopim_access.log combined
</VirtualHost>
```

**Notes**:

* Replace **`/path/to/installation`** with the actual path where UnoPim is installed.
* Ensure that **`/run/php/php8.2-fpm.sock`** matches the socket path defined in **`/etc/php/8.2/fpm/pool.d/www.conf`**.

#### Enabling the Virtual Host

```bash
sudo apache2ctl configtest   # should return "Syntax OK"
sudo a2ensite unopim.local
sudo service apache2 reload
```

#### Adding the Virtual Host Name

Edit your **`/etc/hosts`** file:

```
127.0.0.1    unopim.local
```

Now open **`http://unopim.local`** in your browser to access UnoPim.

---

### Configure Using NGINX

#### Creating the Virtual Host File

Create the file **`/etc/nginx/sites-available/unopim.local.conf`**:

```nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name unopim.local;   # Replace with your dev domain or server IP

    root /home/unopim/html/unopim/public;   # UnoPim document root
    index index.php index.html index.htm;

    # Handle static files (CSS, JS, images)
    location / {
        try_files $uri $uri/ /index.php?$query_string;
    }

    # Handle PHP requests
    location ~ \.php$ {
        include snippets/fastcgi-php.conf;
        fastcgi_pass unix:/run/php/php8.2-fpm.sock;   # Adjust PHP-FPM socket if needed
        fastcgi_param SCRIPT_FILENAME $document_root$fastcgi_script_name;
        include fastcgi_params;
    }

    # Deny access to hidden files like .htaccess
    location ~ /\.ht {
        deny all;
    }

    error_log /var/log/nginx/unopim_error.log;
    access_log /var/log/nginx/unopim_access.log;
}
```

**Notes**:

* Replace **`/home/unopim/html/unopim/public`** with your actual UnoPim installation path if different.
* Make sure PHP-FPM is running (`php8.2-fpm` by default).

---

#### Enabling the Virtual Host

```bash
sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/unopim.local.conf /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/
sudo rm -f /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default   # remove default config
sudo nginx -t   # test config
sudo systemctl reload nginx
```

---

#### Adding the Virtual Host Name

Add this entry to your **`/etc/hosts`** file on your server (and local machine if testing from there):

```
127.0.0.1    unopim.local
```

---


Now open **`http://unopim.local`** in your browser to access UnoPim.
