## Install Using Docker

###  Prerequisites

Make sure the following are installed on your system:

* **Docker** (latest version)
* **Docker Compose** (for Method 2)

Verify installation:

```bash
docker --version
docker-compose --version
```


### Method 1: Using Docker Hub (Quick Setup - Recommended)

This is the **fastest way** to get UnoPim running.

#### Step 1: Pull UnoPim Docker Image

```bash
docker pull webkul/unopim:v0.3.2
```

#### Step 2: Run the Container

```bash
docker run -it -d --name unopim_container -p 80:80 webkul/unopim:v0.3.2
```

If port `80` is already in use, you can map to another port (e.g. `8082`):

```bash
# Stop the container if it is already running
docker stop unopim_container

# Remove the container so you can recreate it cleanly
docker rm unopim_container

# Run a new container on port 8082 instead of 80
docker run -it -d --name unopim_container -p 8082:80 webkul/unopim:v0.3.2
```


Then access UnoPim at:
**`http://localhost:8082`**


#### Step 3: Access UnoPim

Open your browser and visit:
 **`http://localhost`**

**Default Admin Credentials**
(for UnoPim v0.3.2 and newer):

| Version Range    | Username                                          | Password     |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------- | ------------ |
| v0.3.2 (Latest)  | `admin@example.com`                               | admin123     |
| v0.3.0 ‚Äì v0.3.1  | `admin@example.com`                               | admin\@123   |
| v0.2.x and below | `johndoe@example.com`                             | JohnDoe\@123 |

---

#### Database Connection (Optional)

| Key           | Value       |
| ------------- | ----------- |
| Database Name | `unopim_db` |
| Username      | `root`      |
| Password      | `root`      |

---

###  Method 2: Using Docker Compose (For Customization)

This method is ideal if you want **more control** over your UnoPim environment (custom ports, volumes, etc.).

#### Step 1: Clone Repository

Clone the official UnoPim repository:

**HTTPS:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/unopim/unopim.git
```

**SSH:**

```bash
git clone git@github.com:unopim/unopim.git
```

#### Step 2: Enter the Project Directory

```bash
cd unopim
```


#### Step 3: Configure `.env` (before starting containers)

Create a `.env` file by copying the provided example:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Then, open `.env` in your editor and update the database configuration for Docker:

```dotenv
DB_CONNECTION=mysql
DB_HOST=unopim-mysql
DB_PORT=3306
DB_DATABASE=unopim
DB_USERNAME=root
DB_PASSWORD=password
DB_PREFIX=
```

> üí° These values match the services defined in `docker-compose.yml`.
> You can adjust them if you change container names, ports, or credentials.

Once you‚Äôve saved the file, proceed to **Step 4** to start the containers.

#### Step 4: Start Docker Containers

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

This will pull the required images, build containers, and set up the environment.

---

#### Step 5: Access Services

| Service               | URL                                            |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| UnoPim App            | `http://localhost:8000`                        |
| MySQL                 | localhost:3306                                 |

Verify running containers:

```bash
docker ps
```

---

### Managing Services

Stop containers:

```bash
docker-compose down
```

Restart containers:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

Rebuild containers (if configuration changes):

```bash
docker-compose up --build -d
```

### üí° Notes & Tips

* If MySQL is already running locally, change the MySQL container port in `docker-compose.yml` and `.env` file.
* For production, you can configure **persistent volumes** for MySQL data.
* Always restart containers after making `.env` or `docker-compose.yml` changes.

```apache
<VirtualHost *:80>
    ServerName unopim.local

    DocumentRoot /path/to/installation/unopim/public
    <Directory /path/to/installation/unopim/public>
        Options FollowSymLinks MultiViews
        AllowOverride All
        Require all granted
    </Directory>

    ReWriteEngine On

    <FilesMatch \.php$>
        SetHandler "proxy:unix:/run/php/php8.2-fpm.sock|fcgi://localhost/"
    </FilesMatch>

    ErrorLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/unopim_error.log
    LogLevel warn
    CustomLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/unopim_access.log combined
</VirtualHost>
```

**Notes**:

* Replace **`/path/to/installation`** with the actual path where UnoPim is installed.
* Ensure that **`/run/php/php8.2-fpm.sock`** matches the socket path defined in **`/etc/php/8.2/fpm/pool.d/www.conf`**.

#### Enabling the Virtual Host

```bash
sudo apache2ctl configtest   # should return "Syntax OK"
sudo a2ensite unopim.local
sudo service apache2 reload
```

#### Adding the Virtual Host Name

Edit your **`/etc/hosts`** file:

Create the file **`/etc/nginx/sites-available/unopim.local.conf`**:

```nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name unopim.local;   # Replace with your dev domain or server IP

    root /home/unopim/html/unopim/public;   # UnoPim document root
    index index.php index.html index.htm;

    # Handle static files (CSS, JS, images)
    location / {
        try_files $uri $uri/ /index.php?$query_string;
    }

    # Handle PHP requests
    location ~ \.php$ {
        include snippets/fastcgi-php.conf;
        fastcgi_pass unix:/run/php/php8.2-fpm.sock;   # Adjust PHP-FPM socket if needed
        fastcgi_param SCRIPT_FILENAME $document_root$fastcgi_script_name;
        include fastcgi_params;
    }

    # Deny access to hidden files like .htaccess
    location ~ /\.ht {
        deny all;
    }

    error_log /var/log/nginx/unopim_error.log;
    access_log /var/log/nginx/unopim_access.log;
}
```

**Notes**:

* Replace **`/home/unopim/html/unopim/public`** with your actual UnoPim installation path if different.
* Make sure PHP-FPM is running (`php8.2-fpm` by default).

---

#### Enabling the Virtual Host

```bash
sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/unopim.local.conf /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/
sudo rm -f /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default   # remove default config
sudo nginx -t   # test config
sudo systemctl reload nginx
```

---

#### Adding the Virtual Host Name

Add this entry to your **`/etc/hosts`** file on your server (and local machine if testing from there):

```
127.0.0.1    unopim.local
```

---


Now open **`http://unopim.local`** in your browser to access UnoPim.
