# Upgrade Guide

[[Toc]]

## Overview
This guide will help you upgrade your Unopim installation to version 0.2.1. Please follow these instructions carefully to ensure a smooth upgrade process.

## Pre-upgrade Checklist
-  Backup your entire project
-  Backup your database
-  Stop all running processes (queue workers, etc.)

## Upgrade Steps

### 1. Backup Your System
Before proceeding, create a complete backup of your system:

```bash
# Backup database
mysqldump -u your_db_user -p your_db_name > unopim_backup.sql
```

### 2. Download New Version
Download Unopim v0.2.1 from one of these sources:
- [GitHub Release v0.2.1](https://github.com/unopim/unopim/archive/refs/tags/v0.2.1.zip)
- [Official Website](https://unopim.com/download)

### 3. Update Project Files

Update your project files with the new version. You can do this by extracting the downloaded zip file and copying over the necessary files.

```bash
# Extract the new version to your desired location
unzip unopim-0.2.1.zip
```

**Copy your existing configuration and data:**

Copy the `.env` file and storage folder from your current UnoPim installation to the new `unopim-0.2.1` folder:

```bash
# Copy your environment file from current installation
cp /path/to/current/unopim/.env unopim-0.2.1/

# Copy storage directory from current installation
cp -r /path/to/current/unopim/storage/* unopim-0.2.1/storage/
```

**Navigate to the new directory:**

Open terminal at the path of the new `unopim-0.2.1` directory (e.g., `unopim-0.2.1`) and run the commands in the following steps.

**Note:** The upgrade will be completed in this new `unopim-0.2.1` folder. After successful upgrade and testing, you can either:
- Rename the new folder to replace your current installation
- Move the upgraded installation to your required path
- Update your web server configuration to point to the new directory

### 4. Install Dependencies
Make sure you have Composer installed. Navigate to the new Unopim directory and run:
```bash
cd unopim-0.2.1
composer install
```

### 5. Database Updates
If there are any new migrations or database changes, run the following command to update your database schema:
```bash
php artisan migrate
```

### 6. Clear Cache and Optimize
Clear any cached configurations and optimize your application:
```bash
php artisan optimize:clear
php artisan storage:link
```

### 7. Restart Services
If you are using a process manager like Supervisor , restart the services to apply the changes.
```bash
# If using Supervisor
sudo supervisorctl restart unopim-worker
```

## Post-upgrade Steps
1. Test all core functionalities
2. Verify file permissions
3. Check error logs for any issues
