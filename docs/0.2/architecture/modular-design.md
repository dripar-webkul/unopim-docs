# Modular Design in UnoPim

[[Toc]]

UnoPim is built with a modular architecture, offering flexibility, scalability, and easier maintenance. This structure helps developers manage and extend the application efficiently.

## Key Benefits of Modular Design

1. **Separation of Concerns**: Modules focus on specific functionality, keeping different parts of the application clearly separated.
2. **Reusability**: Modules can be reused in other projects, reducing redundancy and speeding up development.
3. **Maintainability**: Isolated modules make it easier to fix bugs and add new features without impacting unrelated parts of the application.
4. **Scalability**: New modules can be added without major changes to the existing code, allowing the application to scale smoothly.

## Module Structure in UnoPim

Each module in UnoPim follows a clear structure, ensuring consistency and easy management. A typical module includes:

- **Config**: Module-specific configuration files.
- **Database**: Migrations, seeders, and factories.
- **Http**: Controllers, middleware, and request handlers.
- **Models**: Eloquent models for data structures.
- **Repositories**: Repository pattern implementations for data access.
- **Resources**: Views, language files, and other resources.
- **Routes**: Module-specific routes.
- **Tests**: Unit and feature tests.

This modular design helps keep the development process clean, organized, and scalable. By following these principles, UnoPim supports the creation of robust and easily maintainable applications.
