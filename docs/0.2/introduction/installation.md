   - SSH: `git clone git@github.com:unopim/unopim.git`

2. **Enter the directory**:  
   ```bash
   cd unopim
   ```

3. **Start the Docker containers**:  
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

   This will pull the necessary images and set up the environment. Once running, access the application at:

## Configuring the Virtual Host

### Creating the Virtual Host File

This guide explains how to create and configure a virtual host for Apache to point to the installation folder of UnoPIM, Create the file **`/etc/apache2/sites-available/unopim.local.conf`**:

```apache
<VirtualHost *:80>
    ServerName unopim.local

    DocumentRoot /path/to/installation/unopim/public
    <Directory /path/to/installation/unopim/public>
        Options FollowSymLinks MultiViews
        AllowOverride All
        Require all granted
    </Directory>

    ReWriteEngine On

    <FilesMatch \.php$>
        SetHandler "proxy:unix:/run/php/php8.2-fpm.sock|fcgi://localhost/"
    </FilesMatch>

    ErrorLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/unopim_error.log
    LogLevel warn
    CustomLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/unopim_access.log combined
</VirtualHost>
```
Notes:
- Replace **`/path/to/installation`** with the actual path where UnoPIM is installed.
- Ensure that **`/run/php/php8.2-fpm.sock`** matches the socket path defined in **`/etc/php/8.2/fpm/pool.d/www.conf`**. Update this value if it differs.

### Enabling the Virtual Host

Run the following commands to enable the virtual host:

   ```bash
   $ sudo apache2ctl configtest
    # This will return 'Syntax OK'

   $ sudo a2ensite unopim.local
   $ sudo service apache2 reload
   ```
### Adding the Virtual Host Name

Add the following entry to your **`/etc/hosts`** file:

   ```
    127.0.0.1    unopim.local
   ```
Your virtual host configuration for UnoPIM is now complete. Visit **`http://unopim.local`** in your browser to access the application.
