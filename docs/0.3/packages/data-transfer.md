## Import

Import is a feature that allows users to import large quantities of data into a system quickly and efficiently. It simplifies the process and saves time by not having to add each piece of information one by one.

The feature works differently for each system and has a vast variety of use cases across many industries as well as [UnoPim](https://unopim.com/).
