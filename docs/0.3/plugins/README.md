## Plugin Development 

### **Plugin Development for Third-Party eCommerce Import/Export**

UnoPim allows for flexible plugin development through a modular approach, and you can easily integrate external eCommerce platforms by building an import/export module within the plugin. These steps guide you through developing a third-party eCommerce plugin.

#### **Directory Structure Example**

Below is a detailed example of how you can organize your plugin with a focus on import/export functionalities:

```

#### **Key Components to Focus On:**

1. **Config (`Config/`)**: 
   - Set up configurations for access control and menu items, allowing users to access your import/export functionality within the UnoPim admin panel.

2. **Import/Export Logic (`Helpers/`)**:
   - **Importer.php**: This file will handle logic for retrieving product data from a third-party API and converting it into the format required by UnoPim.
   - **Exporter.php**: This file will handle the process of taking product data from UnoPim and exporting it to the third-party eCommerce system.

3. **Service Providers (`Providers/`)**:
   - **IntegrationServiceProvider.php**: Responsible for registering the services your plugin provides, like custom commands or background processes.
   - **ModuleServiceProvider.php**: Registers the plugin within UnoPim.

4. **HTTP Controllers (`Http/Controllers/`)**:
   - **IntegrationController.php**: Manages API requests to initiate the import/export process and responds with status updates.

5. **Database (`Database/Migrations/`)**:
   - Define migrations to create tables that log import/export events and results (e.g., `import_export_logs` table).

6. **Routes (`Routes/`)**:
   - Define API routes to handle requests for importing/exporting products (e.g., `POST /integration/import`).

7. **Console Commands (`Console/Commands/`)**:
   - Create CLI commands to automate the import/export process and allow scheduling through Laravel's task scheduler.

#### **Important Considerations**:

- **API Integration**: Your plugin will likely need to connect to third-party APIs (like Shopify, Magento, etc.) to fetch or send product data. Use Laravel's built-in HTTP client or other external libraries to interact with these APIs.
  
- **Data Mapping**: When importing, ensure you map the third-party platform's product schema to UnoPim's data structure properly. Similarly, map UnoPim's data back when exporting.

- **Logging and Error Handling**: Include robust logging for import/export activities, tracking errors or incomplete actions in the `ImportExportLog` model.

- **Event Handling**: Make use of Laravel’s event system to handle triggers for post-import or post-export actions, such as notifying users or generating reports.

This structure ensures your plugin will be modular, organized, and easy to maintain while adding rich import/export capabilities to UnoPim.
